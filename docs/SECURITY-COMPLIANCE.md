## Current Security Posture

### Overall: AT RISK

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Open Security Findings | 4 named: 1 Critical, 2 High, 1 Low |
| GDPR Baseline | 9 gaps, 1 partial control |
| Phases Audited | 1 (Phase 00, 7/7 sessions validated) |
| Last Clean Phase | None |

Phase 00's scoped changes validated successfully and materially strengthened
the MUD integration boundary. The project is still at risk because a production
dependency path has an untriaged critical advisory, two auth/session findings
remain High, and privacy lifecycle requirements are not implemented.

---

## Open Findings

### Critical

#### SEC-DEP-1: Production dependency advisories are untriaged

- **Introduced/confirmed**: [P00-audit], current audit on 2026-09-01.
- **Affected packages**: `backend`, `frontend`.
- **Evidence**: `pnpm audit --prod --json` reports 65 backend advisories (1
  critical, 27 high, 30 moderate, 7 low) and 64 frontend advisories (20 high,
  38 moderate, 6 low). The backend critical advisory reaches
  `fast-xml-parser`; high results include runtime-facing packages such as
  `express-rate-limit`, `jws`, `multer`, `ws`, and `axios` across the two apps.
- **Impact**: Raw advisory presence does not prove every vulnerable function is
  reachable, but production dependency paths are affected and have not been
  traced or upgraded. The one critical path prevents a clean posture claim.
- **Remediation**: Export dependency paths, map each critical/high advisory to
  runtime use, upgrade or replace direct dependencies, record justified
  non-reachability exceptions, then rerun production and full audits plus the
  full test/build matrix.
- **Status**: Open; dedicated dependency-security work required.

### High

#### SEC-RT-1: Refresh tokens are stored as directly replayable JWTs

- **Introduced/confirmed**: [P00-S04], raised from the Session 01 survey.
- **Affected package**: `backend`.
- **Evidence**: `routes/auth.ts` inserts the refresh JWT verbatim into
  `web_sessions.refresh_token`; `sessionService.ts` compares the submitted raw
  token. DurisWeb and the MUD share this database.
- **Impact**: Read access through either codebase, a MUD database backup, or SQL
  injection yields active bearer tokens for every logged-in user. Replays are
  indistinguishable from legitimate refresh requests and tokens last up to
  seven days.
- **Remediation**: Store SHA-256 token digests and compare digests. Keep the raw
  token only in the client cookie. Deployment invalidates all existing sessions
  and therefore needs an explicit rollout/logout decision.
- **Status**: Open.

#### SEC-TZ-1: Session expiry can fail open when host timezones differ

- **Introduced/confirmed**: [P00-S03].
- **Affected package**: `backend`.
- **Evidence**: The application writes `expires_at` from a JavaScript `Date`,
  while `sessionService.ts` compares it with database `NOW()`. With the app at
  UTC+3 and MySQL at UTC, a token already expired by 60 seconds continued to
  authenticate and would have remained valid for nearly three more hours.
- **Impact**: Authenticated sessions silently outlive their intended expiry.
- **Remediation**: Store and compare UTC explicitly (`UTC_TIMESTAMP()` and/or a
  mysql2 `timezone: "Z"` policy), or fail startup when application and database
  timezones disagree. Add an offset-mismatch regression test.
- **Status**: Open.

### Medium / Low

#### SEC-3-2: Toggle and audit writes are not atomic

- **Introduced/confirmed**: [P00-S03].
- **Severity**: Low, accepted for now.
- **Affected package**: `backend`.
- **Evidence**: `hookSettingsService.ts` commits the safety toggle before its
  audit insert. If the audit write fails, the changed toggle remains and the
  error is logged, but no audit record exists.
- **Impact**: A control change can lose its durable attribution during a
  database partial failure.
- **Remediation**: Revisit transaction or outbox designs that preserve the
  higher-priority toggle even when audit persistence fails.
- **Status**: Open, accepted by design; do not silently make the incident safety
  control contingent on audit availability.

## MUD Integration Security Baseline

### Trust Channels

| # | Channel | Direction | Authentication / Boundary | Phase 00 Result |
|---|---------|-----------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| 1 | WebSocket bridge, port 4050 | MUD -> web | HMAC-SHA256 challenge with current/previous secret | Authenticated state/set protocol; remote plaintext refused; TLS verification explicit |
| 2 | Scoped Redis pub/sub | Both | Redis credentials plus namespace and season epoch | Legacy flat channels rejected by contract |
| 3 | Flatfiles and connection log | MUD -> web | Trusted filesystem under `MUD_DIR` | Canonical containment, bounded strict parsing, per-hook health; still unauthenticated by construction |
| 4 | Process control | Web -> MUD host | Admin permissions and constrained command construction | Existing permission/rate-limit contracts retained |
| 5 | Interactive terminal | Web -> host | Admin permission plus live per-session authorization | Always-on recovery path; bubblewrap deliberately shares network and PID namespace |

### Hook-Control Guarantees

- **[P00-S01/S07] Registry and ownership**: 14 immutable rows; 13 website
  toggles, eight MUD-backed hooks, five intentional MUD N/A hooks, and one
  always-on terminal recovery path. Generated behavior tests are cross-checked
  against the exact MUD tuple.
- **[P00-S02/S07] Source suppression**: MUD emitters return before payload
  construction; deletion authenticates and gates before payload parsing;
  disabled donations are dropped before application.
- **[P00-S03/S06] Server-authoritative UI**: Permission checks, optimistic-
  update refusal, mismatch/unknown display, audit context, and safe reconcile
  ordering are covered by backend and frontend tests.
- **[P00-S04/S07] Connection-scoped foreign state**: State is accepted only
  from an authenticated bridge, schema-validated, replaced wholesale, cleared
  on disconnect, and recovered only from a fresh report. Missing state is
  unknown/inactive.
- **[P00-S04] Transport and rotation**: `ws:` is allowed only on loopback;
  non-loopback requires `wss:`; URL credentials/query/fragment are rejected;
  certificate verification is explicit; the previous secret is tried exactly
  once after current-key rejection.
- **[P00-S05] Flatfile boundary**: Reads are realpath-contained and reject
  traversal, escaping symlinks, non-regular files, oversized or growing files,
  NUL, invalid UTF-8, truncated records, and unbounded search work. Failures are
  isolated per hook and exposed without raw paths or payloads.
- **[P00-S07] Cross-repository validation**: 13 website gates, eight MUD gates,
  five N/A owners, reconnect recovery, source guards, configuration, properties,
  state frames, and operator docs are pinned by executable contracts.

### Delivery and Operational Acceptance

- **[P00-external/DurisMUD]** MUD commit `df121bb3` is pushed on
  `feat/durisweb-hook-toggles` and intentionally unmerged. This is the requested
  handoff topology, not proof that the default MUD branch contains the feature.
- **[P00-infra]** Repository tests cannot prove an undeclared production reverse
  proxy. Before any cross-host bridge rollout, an operator must demonstrate a
  certificate-valid WSS connection without weakening the plaintext or
  certificate policies.
- **[P00-infra]** Local backend and frontend health checks pass. A hosting target
  and production health probes remain unset.

## GDPR Compliance Status

### Overall: NON-COMPLIANT BASELINE

The repository processes personal data for accounts, community features,
analytics, donations, operations, and automated suspicion scoring. No privacy
notice, pre-login analytics consent, general erasure workflow, or retention
enforcement was identified. This is an engineering inventory, not legal advice;
deployment jurisdiction and controller/processor roles still require owner
review.

### Personal Data Inventory

| Data | Package / Location | Purpose | Retention / Deletion |
|------|--------------------|---------|----------------------|
| Account and character names | `backend`; shared MUD `accounts` and related tables | Identity, login, authorization, game linkage | No general erasure path identified |
| Email addresses | `backend`; `accounts.email`, `user_profiles.email` | Recovery and account linkage | No documented retention |
| Refresh JWTs | `backend`; `web_sessions.refresh_token` | Session persistence | Up to 7 days; raw storage is SEC-RT-1 |
| IP addresses and reverse DNS | `backend`; page views, login history, action/wipe/builder/deploy/backup records | Security, analytics, geolocation, audit | No purge schedule identified |
| User agent, device, browser, OS, screen size | `frontend` collection, `backend` page-view storage | Analytics | Fingerprint-adjacent; no purge schedule |
| Geolocation, referrer, and UTM data | `backend`; `page_views` | Analytics and attribution | Derived/collected before login; no purge schedule |
| Visitor session identifiers | `frontend`/`backend`; visitor sessions and page views | Link pseudonymous browsing events | No purge schedule |
| Profile text, avatar, website, location | `frontend`/`backend`; `user_profiles` | Public profiles | User-editable, but no general erasure workflow |
| Forum content, reactions, votes, mentions | `frontend`/`backend`; `forum_*` | Community features | Poll vote history retains attributable records |
| Donor name, email, amount, message | `backend`; `donations` | Donation fulfillment and account linkage | Financial/identity data; no documented retention |
| Bans, moderation, and admin actions | `backend`; moderation/audit tables | Safety and accountability | No documented retention |
| Suspicion score and evidence | `backend`; `suspicious_accounts.evidence` | Multi-account detection | Automated profiling; no appeal/erasure path found |
| Push subscription endpoints | `frontend`/`backend`; push service storage | Browser notifications | Revocation exists at browser level; policy not documented |
| User-uploaded images | `frontend`/`backend`; Cloudflare R2 references | Profiles/community content | Feature deletion paths need end-to-end verification |

### Third-Party Transfers

| Recipient | Data sent | Package / Mechanism | Open concern |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------|--------------|
| Google Gemini (`gemini-2.5-flash`) | Account name, character name, IP, login timestamps | `backend`; `geminiSuspicionAnalyzer.ts` | Automated profiling and transfer are not disclosed in-repo |
| ip-api.com | Visitor IP | `backend`; `utils/geoip.ts` | IP is still logged on lookup/error paths |
| Ko-fi | Donor name, email, amount, message | `backend`; webhook and donation services | Processing/retention documentation absent |
| Discord | Notification content | `backend`; `discordService.ts` | Payload minimization not documented |
| Cloudflare R2 | Uploaded images | `backend`; `r2Service.ts` | Retention/deletion agreement not documented |
| Browser push providers | Endpoint and push payload | `frontend`/`backend`; push service | Provider role and retention not documented |

### Compliance Checklist

| Requirement | Status | Evidence / Next action |
|-------------|--------|------------------------|
| Purpose and privacy notice | GAP | No public privacy notice or processing record found |
| Consent before optional analytics storage | GAP | Page-view analytics includes pre-login visitors; no consent gate found |
| Data minimization | PARTIAL | Private presence defaults off unless explicitly enabled; page views still combine IP, device, geo, and screen data |
| Subject access/export | GAP | No complete user data export path identified |
| Deletion/erasure | GAP | No account-wide deletion/anonymization entry point identified |
| Retention enforcement | GAP | No purge job for analytics, login, or audit records identified |
| PII excluded from logs | GAP | Session 05 removed connection-sync IP logs; `utils/geoip.ts` still logs IPs |
| Third-party transfers documented | GAP | Transfers above are inventoried only in this internal file |
| Automated profiling disclosed/contestable | GAP | Gemini suspicion analysis has no subject notice or appeal path identified |
| Credentials protected at rest | GAP | Raw refresh JWT storage remains SEC-RT-1 |

## Dependency Security

Audit date: 2026-09-01. Counts are raw `pnpm audit` advisory results and may
include multiple vulnerable paths; they are not a reachability assessment.

| Package | Scope | Critical | High | Moderate | Low | Total |
|---------|-------|----------|------|----------|-----|-------|
| backend | All dependencies | 3 | 58 | 42 | 10 | 113 |
| backend | Production only | 1 | 27 | 30 | 7 | 65 |
| frontend | All dependencies | 2 | 62 | 52 | 7 | 123 |
| frontend | Production only | 0 | 20 | 38 | 6 | 64 |

Notable critical modules in the full graph are `fast-xml-parser`, `handlebars`,
`tar`, `shell-quote`, and `vitest`; only `fast-xml-parser` remains critical in
the production-only results. Resolve SEC-DEP-1 with path/reachability triage and
upgrades, not by suppressing audit output.

---

## Resolved Findings and Accepted Controls

| Phase / Session | Finding or Risk | Resolution |
|-----------------|-----------------|------------|
| P00-S02 | Low: admin-delete authorization ordering | Authentication and hook state are checked before request parsing or deletion. |
| P00-S02 | Medium: donation concurrency/partial application | Disabled events are discarded before application; concurrency path is contract-tested. |
| P00-S03 | SEC-3-1: unreadable local settings default enabled | Accepted directional policy: avoid severing all integrations while independent MUD gates remain authoritative. |
| P00-S04 | Loopback trust | Accepted and documented; plaintext is loopback-only and production cross-host use requires validated WSS. |
| P00-S04 | Secret rotation gap | Current key plus exactly one previous-key retry is implemented and tested end to end. |
| P00-S05 | Flatfile path/content attacks | Centralized boundary rejects escape, unsafe file type, oversized/growing, malformed, and unbounded input. |
| P00-S05 | Connection log PII emission | IP values are no longer included in connection-sync application logs. |
| P00-S07 | 1 Medium and 2 Low review findings | Gate-order assertion and handoff/commit evidence were repaired before validation. |

---

## Phase History

| Phase | Sessions | Security Result | GDPR Result | Opened | Closed |
|-------|----------|-----------------|-------------|--------|--------|
| P00 | 7/7 | Session validation PASS; cumulative posture AT RISK | NON-COMPLIANT baseline | SEC-DEP-1, SEC-RT-1, SEC-TZ-1, SEC-3-2 | 8 session findings/controls resolved or accepted |

---

## Next-Phase Priorities

1. **[P00-security] Triage and remediate SEC-DEP-1**, starting with the
   production `fast-xml-parser` path and runtime high advisories.
2. **[P00-security] Decide the SEC-RT-1 rollout**, hash refresh tokens, and
   communicate the one-time global logout.
3. **[P00-security] Fix SEC-TZ-1** with explicit UTC semantics and a
   timezone-offset regression test.
4. **[P00-privacy] Assign a privacy owner** for notice/consent, transfer and
   profiling disclosure, retention schedules, and user export/erasure.
5. **[P00-infra] Prove production WSS and health probes** after a hosting target
   is selected; do not weaken transport policy to make rollout pass.
6. **[P00-data] Design the migration baseline and shared-schema ledger repair**
   as separate backup-first work before claiming clean-room deployability.
